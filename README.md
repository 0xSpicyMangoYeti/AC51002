### DundeeZest, a company providing affordable luxury wear for University of Dundee students, plans to upgrade its production line with a conveyor belt system. The system will operate every day from 9amâ€“5pm and requires an operator's input to start daily production. It will produce a set number of items per hour and requires a routine maintenance after a specified number of operating hours. Once this limit is reached, the system will display a 'service required' message, showing the total number of items produced since its last maintenance before the system shuts down. After maintenance, all production data will reset, and the cycle will be repeated
